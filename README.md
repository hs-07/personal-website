# personal-website

This is a very simple website I am building in an effort to dive in learn some basics of html, css, and javascript. It is an experiment I am doing just for fun, so don't take it too seriously! In the future, if I find the time/if I get as far with it as I'd like, perhaps I will use the knowledge I gained to make another website which could function as a sort of resume. However until then, this is just here for me to play with.
